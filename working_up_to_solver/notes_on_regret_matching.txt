1. For each player, initialize all cumulative regrets to 0

2. For some number of iterations:
    - Compute a regret-matching strategy profile. (If all regrets for a player are non-positive, use
a uniform random strategy.)

    - Add the strategy profile to the strategy profile sum.
    - Select each player action profile according the strategy profile.
    - Compute player regrets.
    - Add player regrets to player cumulative regrets.
    - Return the average strategy profile, i.e. the strategy profile sum divided by the number of
        iterations.
