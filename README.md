# poker-game-with-ai:
 
## SUMMARY:
Creating a console poker game that allows user to practice/ practice against a 
bot and other players
Currently only the basic game is functional and the 'bot' implimentation is not yet finished.
Hopefuly pure solver functionality will also be added so that users can see what the bot
thinks the optimal strategy in each particular situation. 
The end goal is to have this as a website.
Curently the Python version is totally complete (has not been extensivley tested there
may be some logical errors)
and the c++ version is not completley finished and most certaininly has bugs and logical errors.
## TO-DO:
1. More testing
2. Add Solver. 
3. Finish C++ version. 
4. Attempt to increase performance in both versions.
